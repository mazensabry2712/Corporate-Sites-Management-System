## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### Issue 1: Column 'project_manager' not found ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Direct column access instead of relationships
**Solution:** Changed to `$project->ppms->name`

### Issue 2: Column 'customer_name' not found ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Direct column access instead of relationships  
**Solution:** Changed to `$project->cust->name`

### Issue 3: Column 'Status' in projects table ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Projects table doesn't have Status column
**Solution:** Added `latestStatus` relationship to Pstatus table

### Issue 4: Wrong foreign key in cascading filters ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Using 'projects_id' instead of 'pr_number'
**Solution:** Changed all whereIn to use 'pr_number' field

### Issue 5: Wrong ENUM values ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Filter dropdowns had wrong enum values
**Solution:** Updated to match database:
- Tasks: 'completed', 'pending', 'progress', 'hold'
- Milestones: 'on track', 'delayed'
- Risks Impact: 'low', 'med', 'high'
- Risks Status: 'open', 'closed'

### Issue 6: Tables not displaying ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Using cards/lists instead of full tables like Reports
**Solution:** Replaced with full responsive tables matching Reports design

### Issue 7: Null vs Empty Collections ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** @if($filteredTasks) failing with empty collections
**Solution:** Initialize as `collect()` and check with `&& count() > 0`

## 📋 Database Structure Verified

### Projects Table
```sql
- id (PK)
- pr_number (unique)
- name
- ppms_id (FK → ppms table)
- aams_id (FK → aams table)
- cust_id (FK → custs table)
```

### Related Tables (all use pr_number = project.id)
```sql
ptasks.pr_number → projects.id
milestones.pr_number → projects.id
invoices.pr_number → projects.id
risks.pr_number → projects.id
pstatuses.pr_number → projects.id
```
